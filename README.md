# The Kitchen at 22 — Digital Menu

Design language inspired by [Action Black](https://www.actionblack.mx/): dark cinematic UI, Bebas Neue display type, lime accent, high contrast, noise grain.

## Run (recommended — shared stock for everyone)

```bash
cd the-kitchen-at-22
python server.py
```

Or double-click **START.bat**. Open **http://localhost:8765**

`server.py` serves the site **and** saves out-of-stock items to `data/stock.json` so all visitors see the same status.

## Admin (dedicated panel)

1. Footer → **Admin** (or open **`/admin.html`**)
2. Enter the **staff admin code** (set in `js/app.js`, `js/admin.js`, and `server.py` — keep it private) → you are redirected to a **separate admin page**
3. Tabs:
   - **Cocina** — live kitchen tickets (created when a guest sends via WhatsApp). Mark **Listo** / **Descartar**. Optimized for iPad & phone.
   - **Aviso** — full-screen public overlay (logo + message). Spanish + English fields, **Traducir ES → EN**, on/off toggle.
   - **Horarios** — open/close/delivery window, force open/closed
   - **Stock** — product + option OOS (tacos Bistec/Pastor, beers, sodas, …)
   - **Menú** — new / weekly special / price
   - **Reportes** — consumption only (by day, apartment, top items/mods). **No prices.**
4. Sync badge: **Servidor local** or **Nube (JSONBin)** means shared persistence

### Shared saves on GitHub Pages (required for “everyone”)

GitHub Pages is **static** — it cannot write files by itself.  
To sync stock / hours / menu / photos for all visitors:

1. Create a free account at [jsonbin.io](https://jsonbin.io)
2. **Create a Bin** and paste the contents of `data/cloud-seed.json` → Save  
3. Copy the **Bin ID** and your **X-Master-Key** (API Keys)
4. Edit `js/config.js`:

```js
window.KITCHEN_CONFIG = {
  jsonbin: {
    binId: "YOUR_BIN_ID",
    masterKey: "YOUR_MASTER_KEY",
  },
  apiBase: "",
};
```

5. Commit & push `js/config.js` (and keep using Admin as usual)

After that, admin changes sync for **everyone** (site polls about every 8s).

| Where you run | How data is saved |
|---------------|-------------------|
| `python server.py` (PC) | Local files in `data/` + `assets/products/` |
| GitHub Pages + JSONBin | Cloud bin (all visitors) |
| No server / no JSONBin | Only this browser (`localStorage`) |

If `data/menu.json` is missing, run: `python _export_menu.py` then refresh `cloud-seed.json` if needed.

### Default order hours

- Open every day **except Tuesday**
- Venue: **2:00 PM – 9:00 PM**
- WhatsApp / delivery orders until **8:30 PM** (device local time)
- Outside that window the send button is grayed out

## Your logo & restaurant photo

1. Copy your files into the `assets/` folder with these exact names:

| File | Use | Tips |
|------|-----|------|
| `assets/logo.png` | Header logo | PNG with transparent background works best |
| `assets/restaurant.jpg` | Big hero image at the top | Wide photo (~1600×1000 or larger) |

2. Refresh **http://localhost:8765**

If a file is missing, the site falls back to the text “22” logo and a stock photo.

Other formats work if you rename them (e.g. `logo.webp` → update `src` in `index.html`).

## Product photos (menu items) — recommended workflow

Browser “upload photo” on the **live GitHub site often fails** (cloud storage size limits).  
Use this instead — simple and reliable:

1. Open folder: **`assets/products/`**
2. Read **`assets/products/README.txt`** — full list of file names (one per product)
3. Save each photo as **`{product-id}.jpg`**  
   Examples:
   - Espresso → `d-espresso.jpg`
   - Burger → `f-burger.jpg`
   - Margarita → `b-margarita.jpg`
4. Also OK: `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.webp`
5. In **GitHub Desktop**: Commit → **Push**
6. Hard-refresh the live site (`Ctrl+Shift+R`)

The site prefers files in `assets/products/` over the old Unsplash stock images.

| Method | Best for |
|--------|----------|
| Drop files in `assets/products/` + Push | **Live site (GitHub Pages)** — use this |
| Admin upload in browser | Only with `python server.py` on your PC |
